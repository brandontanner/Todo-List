# Todo List

### Description

This program allows users to add items to a todo list by typing new todos into an input box. The program stores these todos and lists them in order above the input box. Users can also remove todos from the list by clicking on the todo item they wish to remove.

### How to Run

1. Download the zip file in github and navigate to the **Todo-List-main** directory in the terminal.
2. Run `http-server -c-1`.
3. When that is complete, load **localhost:8080** in the browser and click on the link for **index.html**. This will load the project in the browser.
4. Click on the input box **Add Todo...**, type a new todo, and press the **enter** key to input new todo.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements

- **Check Todo as Complete** I plan to add the functionality of users being able to check-off a todo item as complete by clicking on the item. This would include styling in which, when completed, the todo item would be lined-through.
- **Delete and Edit icons** I plan to move the delete functionality for each todo item to an icon on each item instead of deleting when the item is clicked. I also plan to add editing functionality, also accessed by icon, so that a user can edit previously inputed todo items.
